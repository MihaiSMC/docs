## Overview

Vorn Protocol is developed by LYS Labs, an R&D-driven team building a suite of data and intelligence infrastructure to become the standard for future risk management and capital optimization in DeFi. The system is built on three core pillars: deep data, proprietary AI models, and a smart contract architecture designed for seamless user experience.

The protocol addresses a major pain point in DeFi: power users often manage assets across multiple platforms, each with different risks, APYs, and transaction costs. Manually comparing strategies and reallocating capital to optimize returns is time-consuming and overwhelming.

Vorn Protocol automates this process. By defining a preferred risk level, users enable the AI-powered engine to evaluate thousands of strategies in real-time and deploy capital to the most optimal opportunities. It continuously adjusts allocations based on changing market conditions, removing the need for manual oversight while helping users maintain their risk profile and maximize yield.
